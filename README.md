# Three.js Chess Game

This is a chess game made using the Three.js library and JavaScript. The game includes a 3D chessboard with realistic lighting and materials, move validation, and support for castling and en passant. The game also includes an AI opponent using the Stockfish chess engine.

## Features

- 3D chessboard with realistic lighting and materials
- Move validation and support for castling and en passant
- AI opponent using the Stockfish chess engine

### 3D Chessboard

The chessboard is created using the Three.js library, which is a cross-browser JavaScript library used to create and display 3D computer graphics in a web browser. The board is rendered using the WebGL API, which is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser.

The board is created using a mesh, which is a collection of vertices, edges, and faces that define the shape of the object. The mesh is then textured with a wood texture to give it a realistic appearance. The lighting is done using point lights and ambient light to create a realistic lighting effect.

### Move Validation and Support for Castling and En Passant

The game includes move validation and support for castling and en passant, which ensures that the player can only make valid moves and that pieces are correctly removed from the board when captured.

### AI Opponent using the Stockfish Chess Engine

The game includes an AI opponent that uses the Stockfish chess engine, which is one of the strongest chess engines in the world. The AI opponent provides a challenging opponent for players of all levels.
